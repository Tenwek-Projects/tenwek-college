<p><strong>Tenwek Hospital College</strong></p>
<p>The institution is registered as Tenwek Hospital College with the Technical and Vocational Education and Training Authority (TVETA). The School of Chaplaincy is one of the departments in this college.</p>
<p>Due to changing chaplaincy training needs, the School has redesigned and upgraded its curriculum. This ensures consistency with the ongoing development of competency-based curriculum in institutions of learning across Kenya.</p>
<p>The School works closely with Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and its arm, the Curriculum Development, Assessment and Certification Council (CDACC), in the development of both Certificate and Diploma in Chaplaincy curricula that are nearing completion. The Certificate and Diploma in Chaplaincy will be examined by CDACC.</p>
